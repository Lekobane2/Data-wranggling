DATA ANALYSIS
# Data-wranggling
Data wrangling, also known as data munging, is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a format suitable for analysis.Transforming: Converting data types, normalizing, and aggregating data. Organizing: Structuring data into tables or datasets that are easy to analyze.
# Data Wrangling Project

This project involves data wrangling tasks performed in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook demonstrates how to clean, preprocess, and transform data for analysis.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-wrangling-project.git
cd data-wrangling-project
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
#Install  required Python packages using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch Jupyter Notebook to view and run the project.
Once Jupyter Notebook is running, open the data_wrangling_project.ipynb file and run the cells to see the data wrangling steps in action.
